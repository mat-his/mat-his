 ## Background

 Software Engineer for years, I'm focusing on IoT projects based on best technologies : Linux, Rust, Python.
 - C.O.D.D.E. Pi: The all-in-one app to create and control your next DIY project
 - codde_example: Practical embedded usecases for CODDE Pi app
 - newport_controller: Python console to interact with and set up the NewPort Piezzo Controller

 ## Tools

Arch Linux and Sway enthusiasts the whole config being versioned by [chezmoi](https://github.com/mat-his/dotfiles). 

I built my own distro and hope to [package it](https://github.com/windylinux) for everyone.

Neovim user forever, [Astronvim](https://astronvim.com/) is the best tool compiling NeoVim plugins elegantly.

## Next Targets

-> Bring Google Nearby technology to CODDE Pi framework.

-> Port Open Source tools (MicroPython, Microblocks, Fritzing, Python IDE) to the mobile world.

-> Make Rust a strong alternative to C/C++ in the embedded world.
